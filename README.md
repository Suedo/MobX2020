### MobX2020

This is a React MobX with TypeScript and Hooks demo project, inspired by [Leigh Halliday's tutorial on MobX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnhIJA64ByY&t=670s "Leigh Halliday's tutorial on MobX")

##### Features in this project:

1. Uses TypeScript
2. Uses react hooks, as well as creating custom hooks
3. Branch "**function-based-hooks**" show creating MobX stores using the `useLocalStore` hook
4. Branch "**sladav**" shows creating MobX stores using the more common Class and decorators based approach.
5. Shows how to tie up multiple stores together into one Root Store, and pass them around, by creating a handy `useStore` custom hook
